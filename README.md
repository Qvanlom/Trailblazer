## Trailblazer: Blaze Trails™© in your fantasy maps™©
# Inspiration
Creating fantasy maps for your roleplaying games can be quite hard, especially when you have to make roads or connections between towns and kingdoms. So we decided to build a tool that optimally creates those paths for you!
# What it does
Given a series of points representing cities on a map, our tool will generate the shortest paths between those cities, creating new intermediate nodes as necessary.
# How we built it
Just plain old HTML,CSS, and JS.
# Challenges we ran into
We spent a lot of time figuring out the mathematics behind our path generation algorithms, and had trouble initializing our GitHub repo.
# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Ian got second in the Geico balloon race.
# What we learned
white castle isn't that great when it's cold
